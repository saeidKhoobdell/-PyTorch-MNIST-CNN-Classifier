# CNN Classifier for MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier implemented in PyTorch for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification. This project demonstrates how to build and train a CNN model using PyTorch to achieve high accuracy on this dataset.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-cnn-classifier.git
cd mnist-cnn-classifier
```

2. Train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. Evaluate the model:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture used in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers. The architecture details can be found in the `model.py` file.

## Results

After training the model, you can expect to achieve an accuracy of over 99% on the MNIST test set. The actual performance may vary depending on hyperparameters and training settings.
